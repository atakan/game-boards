# game-boards
Tools for making boards for games.

I plan to develop tools for producing SVG for game boards easily.
As a side effect, this might produce tools for producing SVGs, and I plan
to extend this to counters as well. If possible, I very much would like to
turn these into inkscape plug-ins.

For me, the actual aim of the project is to learn Common Lisp programming.

which is published by SPI.
I plan to make the board for this, and possibly the counters.
